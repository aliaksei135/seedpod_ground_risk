# SEEDPOD Ground Risk Prototype

Proof of Concept demonstrating modelling of ground risk from open source data sources.

All data processing is performed locally, so performance depends on your machine spec. At least 8GiB of RAM is essential
however.

Developed as part of the [SEEDPOD project](https://cascadeuav.com/seedpod/) funded by the CASCADE programme
grant ([EP/R009953/1)](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R009953/1).

## Method

### Residential population density

### Hourly road traffic population

***This is intended to provide guidance on overflight risks in terms of risk-to-life (RtL) and is by no means an
extensive or complete picture of the ground risks. While the software is intended to promote safe drone flight, use of
this software does not in itself guarantee safe or legal drone operation. Follow
